  Analyze the player's past performance and suggest a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) that will provide a challenging but fair game.
  Explain your reasoning for the suggestion.

  Past Performance: {{{pastPerformance}}}

  Consider the following guidelines:

  - Easy: Suitable for players who are new to chess or have a low win rate.
  - Medium: Suitable for players with a moderate win rate and some experience with chess strategies.
  - Hard: Suitable for experienced players with a high win rate and a strong understanding of chess strategies.
