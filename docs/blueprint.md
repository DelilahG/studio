- Background color: Very light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a subtle contrast to the dark brown, reminiscent of aged paper or parchment.
- Accent color: Deep gold (#FFAB40) used for highlighting active pieces or squares, adding a touch of elegance and indicating interactivity.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel.
- Use classic chess piece icons in a minimalist style. Consider a slightly embossed or 3D effect.
- Clean, uncluttered layout with the chessboard as the central focus. Use subtle borders and spacing to separate UI elements.
- Subtle transitions for piece movements. A smooth, gliding motion enhances the user experience without being distracting.
